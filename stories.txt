    Title: I made a fake person for fun, and now my real friends like her more than me.
    Story:
    I was messing around with this AI photo generator one night — the kind where you upload a few selfies and it gives you crazy realistic shots in all sorts of styles. I had an idea: What if I made a new identity? Just for fun.
    I created “Sophie” — a girl with perfect hair, mysterious bookworm vibes, and great taste in music. Added her to a side Instagram, followed a few of my friends, posted some generated pics of her hiking, reading, drinking matcha…
    Then something unexpected happened:
    My friends started loving Sophie. One added her to a group chat. Another told Sophie something she never told me. They bonded. They invited Sophie to an event I wasn’t even invited to.
    Plot twist? They never realized it was me. Sophie didn’t exist. She was a handful of AI-generated photos, and me texting like I imagined a cooler version of myself would.
    Now I don’t know what to do. Delete her? Confess? Or… just let Sophie ghost them slowly?
