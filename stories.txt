Title: AITA for using a template to design an ad that outperformed my manager's original work?
Story:
I’m a junior marketing assistant at a small agency. Last week, our client asked for a last-minute Instagram ad for their spring launch. My boss was on vacation, and I didn’t want to mess up — so I looked for some inspiration online and stumbled across this site full of ready-to-use ad designs.
Instead of starting from scratch, I picked a layout that looked like something Glossier or Apple would post, swapped in our copy, and sent it to the client.
Plot twist?
It became their best-performing ad ever. The client raved. My boss came back, saw the numbers… and got weirdly quiet. Next thing I know, I’m getting passive-aggressive comments like,
“Well, some of us still believe in original work.”
AITA for using a shortcut that worked? Or should I have waited and let the opportunity pass?
